# AI Spanish Poet

> Here will be the final poem generated by the model

* Note: above love poem was written by an Artificial Intelligence algorithm

## Deep learning model to generate spanish love poems

This a  mini-project developed for a "Sant Jordi" poem contest hosted at my company.

The idea is to train a deep learning model to write spanish love poems
First, the model will be tranined with thousands of famous spanish poems
Then, train it to write love theme poems trough transfer learning technique

## First at all, what is Sant Jordi's day?
**It is a celebration of culture and love, represented by books and roses**

Sant Jordi, or St. George, is the patron saint of Catalonia.
La Diada de Sant Jordi is celebrated every April 23, it is a festive occasion that, over the years, has become a celebration of Catalan culture.

It is the most romantic day of the year when everyone, not just couples, give a rose or a book to one another and fill every street corner with hope, happiness and love.

## What is the contest about?
One month prior La Diada de Sant Jordi's day a writing contest was opened in my company to celebrate it
However there was a tricky point, the theme was about artificial Intelligence. That means all submissions must contain an explicit or implicit reference to this concept or technology

The prize awards were good, 150â‚¬ for the winner so, I decided to take part in the contest. As I'm not a good writer but I work with AI models, I though to put in practice some of my NLP and DL skills in practice.


## How the AI poet was trained?
General description of the project structure
how to run it?


## Data
webscraping and data insights


## Training with general theme
model iteration and final network

```python
model = Sequential()
# Mask parts of the lookback period that are all zeros (i.e., unobserved) so they don't skew the model
model.add(Masking(mask_value=-1., input_shape=(train_x.shape[1], train_x.shape[2])))
# layer 1
model.add(LSTM(HIDDEN_NEURONS, return_sequences=True))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
# layer 2
model.add(LSTM(HIDDEN_NEURONS, return_sequences=True)))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
# layer 3
model.add(LSTM(HIDDEN_NEURONS))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
# Final layer
model.add(Dense(train_y.shape[1], activation='softmax'))
# compile
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              optimizer='adam',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```
